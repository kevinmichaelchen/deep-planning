This site is a companion to the [DeepPlanning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18137) — a benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning with verifiable constraints.

## What is DeepPlanning?

DeepPlanning evaluates how well AI agents handle complex, real-world planning tasks that require **global constrained optimization**. It features two core task types:

- **Multi-day travel itineraries** — agents must plan trips satisfying budget, time, preference, and logistical constraints simultaneously.
- **Multi-product shopping tasks** — agents must research and select products meeting multiple interacting requirements.

These tasks go beyond simple instruction-following. They require agents to search for information, reason over constraints, and produce plans that are globally optimal — not just locally plausible.

## What's in this collection?

We've curated **38 papers** across 9 categories that represent the landscape of work related to DeepPlanning:

- **Planning Benchmarks** — other benchmarks that evaluate planning and reasoning
- **Travel Planning** — systems and benchmarks for travel itinerary generation
- **Shopping and Search Agents** — e-commerce and local search agent evaluation
- **Web Agent Benchmarks** — general web interaction benchmarks
- **Tool Use and APIs** — frameworks for tool-augmented LLMs
- **Foundation Models** — the models being evaluated on these tasks
- **Agent Evaluation Frameworks** — meta-benchmarks and evaluation methodology
- **LLM Reasoning and Verification** — work on self-verification limitations
